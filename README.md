# ProjectGooglePageElysea
I reproduced the Google homepage for THP. The goal was to build the structure and then a CSS file to style it. It was challenging.

I used AI assistance for the glowing halo hover effect on the login button, as well as for the mic and Lens logos. I added this to learn a bit more about styling buttons. I’m going to need more information regarding those last two.

Thanks to THP for this exercise. It was very interesting!
