# ProjectGooglePageElysea
I reproduced the Google homepage for THP.

The aim was to set up the structure and then style it with CSS. It was tough!

The glowing hover effect on the login button and the colors for the mic and lens logos were done with the help of AI. I added them to practice styling buttons. I definitely need more info on those last two, though.

Thanks to THP for this assignment. It was really interesting!
